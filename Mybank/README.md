# CAVC Project


In this project I upgraded the original project what we did during the Fintech BackEnd course at Cardiff and Vale College.

After the course I kept on studying PHP and Python, especially OOP and It was what I use to make this project.

Basically I create a management system for our database.  A CRUD system.

I use knowledge of:
* Html
* CSS
* Javascript
* PHP: using OOP
* SQL

I can resume the file system in four blocks: 

- index.html -> First page where we a create a basic login system.
- login.php -> This file is responsible for validating our login.
- Employee.php -> Once our login is successful, we access the employee area where we can perform different tasks such as inserting a new record, searching for a record, updating a record...
- The rest of files: the files where different operations are taken.
    - Insert a new record.
    - Show a list of the customers, where we can update, delete a record.
    - Search a customer, and then we can do different operations.
