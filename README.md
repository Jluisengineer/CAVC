# CAVC
This is what I did during the CAVC college and the imporvments i did after the course.

Ther are two folders:

  * My bank CAVC Course: Porject we did during the course. It is a management system (CRUD), using php and procedural programming.
  * Mybank: An update of what I did during the course. In this ocassion I use OOP to make the CRUD.
  * Currently I am studying Laravel, so when i finish it my intention is to make the same project using laravel and MVC.
